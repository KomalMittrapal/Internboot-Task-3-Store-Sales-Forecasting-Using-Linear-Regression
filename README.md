# Internboot Task 3 - Store Sales Forecasting Using Linear Regression 
### A Beginner-Level Machine Learning Project for Predicting Daily Sales Using Time, Promotions, and Holiday Features

## 🔧 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Joblib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🧠 **Problem Statement**

Retail stores must predict daily sales to plan inventory, staffing, and promotions.  
This project uses **Linear Regression** to model:

- 📅 **Time trend**  
- 🎯 **Promotional activity**  
- 🎉 **Holiday effects**  

The model predicts future sales based on these features.

## 📊 **Dataset Information**

Dataset Source:  
[Kaggle – Store Sales Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)

Typical columns include:
- `date`
- `sales`
- `promotion` / `onpromotion`
- `holiday_flag`
- `oil_price`

## 📘 **Project Summary**

This project is part of my Internboot Data Analytics Internship (Beginner Level).  
The objective is to **build a simple Linear Regression model** to predict store sales using **date**, **promotions**, and **holiday indicators** as features.

The project provides hands-on experience with:
- Time-based feature engineering  
- Cleaning and preparing real business data  
- Building a Regression model with scikit-learn  
- Performing model evaluation  
- Visualizing predictions  
- Creating professional reporting & GitHub documentation  

This repository contains all deliverables including code, cleaned data, visuals, and a final report.
